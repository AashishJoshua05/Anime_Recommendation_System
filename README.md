# Anime Recommendation System
This recommendation system uses the rating prediction to suggest similar anime
to watch for the user, it makes use of the 
kaggle anime data set =[kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database)
and inspiration was taken from 
GeeksforGeeks website = [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recommendation-system-in-python/)

A vector Rx is taken for the user's anime watched, and it is being compared to 
The other user rating of that anime and being recommended similar anime to which
the other users liked and rated in a similar manner.
The formula:
