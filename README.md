# Anime Recommendation System
This recommendation system uses the rating prediction to suggest similar anime
to watch for the user, it makes use of the 
[kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database)
and inspiration was taken from 
[geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recommendation-system-in-python/)

## Ideology Behind the Code.
A vector Rx is taken for the user's anime watched, and it is being compared to 
The other user rating of that anime and being recommended similar anime to which
the other users liked and rated in a similar manner.
The formula:

## To Run the Code
Run the **Anime_Recommendation_System.py** on your system and input an anime of your choice
if the anime is present in the database you will be suggested a minimum of 10 animes that are similiar 
to the anime that you have inputted. The program will explain itself with the comments and also while running.
